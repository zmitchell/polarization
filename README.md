# Polarization

This is a barebones library for doing Jones calculus. It is currently a work in progress, so most of the functionality is missing. I have plans to implement the following optical elements:

* Linear polarizer (done)
* Polarization rotator (done)
* Quarter wave plate (done)
* Half wave plate (done)
* Arbitrary retarder
* Reflection from a dielectric surface
* Reflection from a metal surface

I plan to wrap this library in a CLI program. Another planned feature is the ability to specify the configuration of an optical system in a TOML file to ease the analysis of more complicated optical systems.
